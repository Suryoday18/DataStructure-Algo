//An object {nail: 1000} will pass through the Hash generator function and it will assign the object to any memory.
// Two Characterstics of the Hash Generator: 
// 1. One-way: with the assigned address, you can't get back the object
// 2. Deterministic: It will assign the same address for the one given object, if {nail: 1000} -> 2 same for {nail: 1000} -> 2
//Collissions: Two values in the same spot of the memory
