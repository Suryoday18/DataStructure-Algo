Full Binary Tree: Every Item either points to two nodes or Zero Nodes
Perfect Binary Tree: Every Line has items in it.
Complete Binary Tree: A tree in which every level, except possibly the deepest, is entirely filled
A Node that doesn't have a children is called a leaf.
A binary tree only have - Every item should have 2 or 0 nodes not more than that.
All lesser value will go to left and higher value goes to right in BST
to find the item in BST we have O(logn) - Divide and Conquer - As all the lesser values are in left whereas higher value are in right
lookup, insert, remove - O(logn)
